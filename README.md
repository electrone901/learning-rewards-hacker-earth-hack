#### Name: Learning Rewards

#### Summary

Learning Rewards is an application that helps educate and onboard both users and developers into DeFi. Companies and creators will be able to create new quizzes and projects. Users will be able to learn and earn tokens, experience points and practical knowledge.

#### What it does

Defi is a revolutionary and ever-expanding space that is still widely unknown to the masses. There are problems with Defi applications:

- High entry barrier: tech-intensive, major projects are not user-friendly
- Scattered information: learning required intensive research
- Inefficient user acquisition: masses are not incentivized enough to learn, participate, and contribute to the Defi ecosystem.

This is why weâ€™ve built Learning Rewards. Learning Rewards is an on-chain quests platform built for all blockchains where users can engage in on-chain tasks called and be rewarded for doing so with token rewards, NFT completion badges, and experience points on the platform.

We believe Learning Rewards will help:

- Onboard new users into web3
- Increase user engagement during current market conditions from existing users
- Help educate anyone about the ecosystem through hands-on on-chain experiences.

We also want to incentivize learners and builders by tipping NFTs using NFTPort for multi-chain NFT minting, and data transparency.

### What's next for Learning Rewards

We would like to keep working on:
Adding more incentives for creators and users
Verify users using the WorldCoin protocol
Find partnerships to launch officially
Build a better responsive UI
Add testing and monitoring our smart contract

### How it's made

We are using React, next js in the front end, and Metamask and Coinbase in order to log in.
In the backend, it's mainly Solidity, Openzeppelin, NodeJS, TypeScript, and GraphQL. We are querying data from the Everest Subgraph and Uniswap v2 subgraph. We're storing that data in IPFS
